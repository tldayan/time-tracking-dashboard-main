This project represents my solution for the Time Tracking Dashboard challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a visually appealing dashboard for tracking time, displaying various statistics and data related to time management.

## Overview

The Time Tracking Dashboard challenge focused on building an intuitive and informative dashboard that effectively presents time-related statistics and data. The goal was to create a design that allows users to track and analyze their time usage efficiently.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create a visually engaging dashboard that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

By leveraging CSS techniques, I aimed to enhance the design with attention to detail, ensuring that the statistics and data are presented in a visually appealing and organized manner. The use of color schemes, typography, and data visualization techniques played a crucial role in creating an effective and user-friendly dashboard.
